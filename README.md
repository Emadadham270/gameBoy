# GameBoy Project in ARM Assembly

## Overview
This repository contains the source code for a GameBoy-inspired project implemented in ARM assembly language. The project was developed by a team of 8 students from the Faculty of Engineering at Cairo University.

## Project Description
Our project aims to recreate classic GameBoy functionality using ARM assembly programming. The implementation leverages low-level hardware manipulation through direct register access and efficient assembly coding techniques.
